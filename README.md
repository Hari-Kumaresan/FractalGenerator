# Fractal Generator

This project prompts the user for input to create an active live background loading screen depicting multi-colored pipes on a black screen appearing and disappearing with randomized lengths and directions.

* Implemented Java Swing to create a GUI of Interconnected Pipes appearing and disappearing in
randomized patterns through recursive implementation and backtracking.
* Enhanced the efficiency of the program through the use of Stacks holding Graphic Point objects.
